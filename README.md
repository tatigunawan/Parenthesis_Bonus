# Parenthesis Bonus 
# Parenthesis Bonus Implementation
## Description
This Project demonstrates an algorithm that allows you to design the parenthesization to maximize the value of an expression.

It includes:

- A manual implementation using Pythonâ€™s built-in data structures.

## Problem

The following is the problem that we are here to solve:

Your boss has written an arithmetic expression of n terms to compute your annual bonus, but permits you to parenthesize it however you wish. Give an efficient algorithm to design the parenthesization to maximize the value. For
the expression:

6+2*0-4 

There exist parenthesizations with values ranging from -32 to 2.

## Dataset

Our dataset consists of the following digits based off the problem: 6, 2, 0, 4
